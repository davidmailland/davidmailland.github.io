This conference paper evaluates the applicability of a model-based approach to support
dependability engineers performing RAMS (Reliability, Availability, Maintainability,
Safety) analyses in the space domain using the open-source Capella tool, based on the
Arcadia methodology. The approach aims to improve co-engineering activities during
spacecraft design and explores preliminary applications and future improvements. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}</div>
