<div style="text-align: justify;">
We propose a Petri-net-based modelling of the inverse dynamics of the Collatz conjecture.
The construction reveals a structured tree of predecessors up to a bounded domain and
allows the study of reachability, liveness, and recurrence properties using formal
methods.
